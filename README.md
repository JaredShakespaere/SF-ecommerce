# The Problem
I want to make it easier for me as a online business owner to present products to my clientele. This ecommerce page can solve that issue by allowing the client to navigate through proteins and supplements, see the different online training packages we offer, add items to cart, and check out. 

ShakespaereFit is an online platform that assists everyday people and athletes in becoming the best version of themselves. 

# MVP Requirements
iterate over an api that contains health and fitness supplements. Preferably from Repp Sports. 

Navigation Bar that allows the user to easily navigate to key parts of the app. 

Page that shows the different available training packages.

Page that shows supplements.

Feature that allows people to add products to cart and a seperate cart page that shows the products that were added.

Checkout feature that walks users through checkout and payment info.

Integrate Stripe API with the checkout feature.



# Mobile/Desktop
App will be designed for mobile and appeal to the everyday gym-goer that is on the move.

# Difficulty
Medium

This project has some nice complexity as you will need to make 2 API calls:

products pulled from Repp Sports or another supplement company.

Stripe API that will be integrated with the checkout feature.

Aside from that, this is a straight-forward ecommerce app with a big emphasis on clean UI/UX. 

# Possible Extensions
Add an About Us page.

When we get more trainers, add a 'book with me' feature that allows a user to choose a trainer they want to work with.

Add a login feature so returning customers can have their info saved.

Add clients training program to the site that can only be accessed when logged in.

Add weight tracker to app.
